### Almost done!

It's time to publish the Design Thinking toolkit you've been working on.

To publish:

1. Go to the **Settings** tab for this repository
1. Scroll down to the section titled _GitHub Pages_
1. Select **main branch** in the Source drop down

That's all! GitHub Pages will then deploy your site and report its status back to me.
